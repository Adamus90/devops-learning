Ok, so let's make this file my progress log so far:

1. I'm learning git with Bryan Krausen
2. Learning and practicing basic git workflow like creating and deleting files + adding (staging area), restoring, commiting to local repository and pushing changes to github repository.
3. At this moment I have full understanding for basic worfklow and the difference between my local repository and remote repository.
4. Cloned my repo to my other PC at work so I can practice there as well.
